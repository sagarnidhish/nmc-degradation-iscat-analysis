# Objectives And Observations

Last updated: 2026-05-21

## Working Objective

Use the Alek_Jiho NMC degradation data and the SP/FOV charge-photometry video work to build AI analyses that extract physically useful signals, not just low pixel error. The main targets are particle-region-only prediction, rollout, phase-boundary/proxy tracking, apparent transport/degradation observables, and correlations between cycle number, region, particle behavior, and degradation events.

## Current Evidence

- Alek_Jiho raw/derived data are on Isambard under `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho`.
- The large electrochemistry CSV is present at `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/alek_jiho_nmc_deg/echemDF_full/echemDF_full.csv`; Tier 1 path discovery has been updated to search this location.
- Particle intensity event targets are already generated under `derived/particle_event_targets`.
- The event target table has 356 particle-cycle rows from 4 particles across 89 cycles.
- Abrupt optical drop events are concentrated around cycles 86 and 116 for particles 0-2, with particle1 also at 156 and particle3 at 60. This makes synchronized degradation events a strong hypothesis rather than isolated particle noise.
- Transparent leave-one-particle-out feature baselines show weak but nonzero precursor signal: best F1 is about 0.35 at 10 cycles, 0.36 at 20 cycles, and 0.44 at 40 cycles.
- Existing SP work has already extracted ROI masks, phase labels, per-frame optical observables, and boundary/phase-front proxies for all 8 SP videos.
- Existing pixel rollout models remain weaker than desired: Walrus true rollout has particle MAE ratio near 1.0 and unstable mean-intensity slopes; physics-constrained U-Net training histories plateau around validation rollout MAE 5-6.
- Project decision summaries therefore support moving the central target from pixel recreation to physical-observable forecasting under future electrochemical controls.

## Active Isambard Jobs

As of the latest check, the relevant pending jobs are:

- `4687055` `tier1_nmc_eda`
- `4687056` `tier2_nmc_ml`, dependent on Tier 1
- `4687057` `tier3_nmc_dl`, dependent on Tier 2
- `4687712` `obs_res_gru` for SP physical-observable residual forecasting
- `4687884` `fov_particles`, followed by FOV QC, FOV residual GRU, and FOV observable baselines
- `4687040` and `4687041` probabilistic rollout evaluations for v5/v6

## Computational Experiments To Prioritize

1. NMC synchronized-event validation: test whether the shared event cycles around 86/116 align with capacity fade, dQ/dV changes, cycle frame counts, or HighCOV protocol changes. Use shuffled-cycle and shuffled-particle controls.
2. NMC event forecasting: treat abrupt intensity drops as survival/hazard targets and compare transparent features, gradient boosting, and sequence models with grouped cross-validation by particle/session.
3. SP observable residual forecasting: forecast mean, P95/P99, bright fraction, histogram bins, and boundary proxy from past observables plus future current/voltage/time. Evaluate against persistence by phase and around transitions.
4. Particle-region-only video rollouts: keep ROI/mask selection fixed from robust temporal evidence; when drift correction blurs a frame, propagate the prior ROI rather than thresholding the blurred frame independently.
5. Physics-readiness extraction: rank phase-front candidates by coherent-front score, mask uncertainty, monotonicity, and fit quality. Do not interpret apparent diffusion coefficients as physical constants until spatial calibration and manual front validation are available.
6. Probabilistic rollout calibration: evaluate uncertainty using CRPS and physics-observable coverage, not only pixel metrics. Useful uncertainty should widen near transitions and regions with larger mask/phase uncertainty.

## Current Interpretation

The strongest route is a two-track program. For Alek_Jiho NMC degradation, focus first on cycle-level particle-event and electrochemical coupling because the provided CSV/PPT-derived tables already expose degradation structure. For SP videos, focus on ROI physical-observable and boundary-proxy forecasting because ordinary autoregressive pixel rollout has repeatedly plateaued. Pixel models remain useful when constrained by ROI, future EC controls, and physical losses, but the scientific claims should be made from validated observables and controls.

## 2026-05-21 Event Synchrony Result

A new lightweight synchrony analysis was added in `scripts/tier1_event_synchrony_analysis.py` and run on Isambard. It preserves each particle's number of abrupt-drop events while randomly permuting event cycles over that particle's observed cycle grid.

Output directory: `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_synchrony`

Key result:

- Three particles (`particle0`, `particle1`, `particle2`) event together at cycles 86 and 116.
- Permutation p-value for observing a same-cycle maximum of 3 particles: 0.003300.
- Permutation p-value for observing two cycles with at least two particles eventing: 0.016649.
- Those synchronized cycles have low cycle-frame percentiles (cycle 86: 0.079; cycle 116: 0.011), so the next check is whether these cycles correspond to electrochemical/protocol changes rather than independent local particle failures.

Interpretation: synchronized optical degradation timing is now a concrete hypothesis worth validating against echem capacity, dQ/dV, current/voltage protocol, and shuffled-cycle controls.

## 2026-05-21 Event-Echem Coupling Result

A targeted chunked scan of `echemDF_full.csv` was added in `scripts/tier1_event_echem_coupling.py` and run on Isambard while the larger Slurm jobs remained pending.

Output directory: `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_echem_coupling`

Key result:

- 81 of 89 particle cycles matched to electrochemistry summaries.
- The synchronized optical event cycles both have echem matches:
  - cycle 86: 3 particles, frame-count percentile 0.079, `galvanostatic_2`, mean V 3.822, mean current 0.00349 mA.
  - cycle 116: 3 particles, frame-count percentile 0.011, `galvanostatic_10`, mean V 3.904, mean current 0.00704 mA.
- Simple per-cycle echem summaries do not explain event occurrence on their own; strongest exploratory differences are lower frame count / lower frame-count percentile for event cycles, but p-values are not strong with only four event cycles.
- Cycle 156 has an optical event for particle1 but no echem match in this scan, so downstream statistics should treat it carefully.

Interpretation: the synchronized optical events are unlikely to be random particle-local coincidences, but they are not yet explained by coarse per-cycle voltage/current summaries. The next useful analyses are protocol-local checks around the event cycles, visual/ROI validation, and image-derived degradation features within those cycles.

## 2026-05-21 Protocol Context Result

A protocol-context pass was added in `scripts/tier1_event_protocol_context.py` using the compact event/echem cycle table.

Output directory: `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_protocol_context`

Key result:

- Synchronized event cycles 86 and 116 have low frame counts: mean 895.5 frames versus 1036.1 for non-synchronized cycles, Mann-Whitney p = 0.0240.
- The same cycles are at very low frame-count percentiles: 0.079 and 0.011.
- Block-position inference was not reliable because dominant block labels produce 82 inferred block segments across 89 particle cycles; treat those boundary features as exploratory only.

Interpretation: synchronized optical degradation events are now linked most clearly to unusually short cycle-frame regimes, not to coarse voltage/current summaries. The next check should inspect raw frame/video quality and particle ROI behavior around cycles 86 and 116 to distinguish physical abrupt degradation from imaging/protocol/frame-count artifacts.

## 2026-05-21 Event Recovery QC Result

A recovery/persistence QC pass was added in `scripts/tier1_event_recovery_qc.py` and run on Isambard using the provided particle intensity traces, cycle-frame metadata, and source HDF5 address strings.

Output directory: `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_recovery_qc`

Key result:

- The synchronized event cycles are not single-cycle transients in the particle trace table.
- Cycle 86: particles 0/1/2 drop together by a mean 14.2%; all 3 remain sustained into the next observed cycle. The next-cycle recovery fraction is negative on average because the following cycle is even lower.
- Cycle 116: particles 0/1/2 drop together by a mean 19.2%; all 3 remain sustained into the next observed cycle despite partial recovery.
- Single-particle event cycles 60 and 156 also have sustained next-cycle deficits, but they are not synchronized across particles.
- Chopped cycle HDF5 files referenced by the Windows-style `addrs` field are not present on Isambard; only the full session HDF5 files are present. Therefore this QC uses trace-level evidence and full-file metadata, not direct particle crops.

Interpretation: the strongest synchronized events behave like persistent degradation-like optical changes rather than one-cycle trace artifacts. The remaining uncertainty is spatial: raw-frame ROI validation is still needed to confirm the drops are in the particle regions and not due to segmentation/object-detection drift in the original trace extraction.

## 2026-05-21 Full-HDF5 Frame Proxy QC Result

A sampled full-frame QC pass was added in `scripts/tier1_event_frame_proxy_qc.py` and run on Isambard because the chopped cycle HDF5 files referenced by `exampleParticles.csv` are not present on Isambard.

Output directory: `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_frame_proxy_qc`

Key result:

- The script sampled 11 full-HDF5 cycle segments: 4 event cycles and 7 nearest represented neighbor cycles.
- It read only downsampled sampled frames from the full `movie` datasets and generated preview PNGs plus ROI/background metrics.
- Event cycles sampled: 60, 86, 116, 156.
- Synchronized event cycle 86 was sampled from `10_c2_x10_030723.hdf5`, inferred local segment 1, frames 906-1812.
- Synchronized event cycle 116 was sampled from `13_c2_x6_100723.hdf5`, inferred local segment 1, frames 909-1818.
- Mean event proxy ROI fraction was 0.0629 versus 0.0410 for neighbor segments.
- Mean event sampled XY stage drift was 0.176 versus 0.148 for neighbor segments; this is not obviously catastrophic at this coarse sampled scale.
- Proxy masks required fallback thresholding in the sampled segments, so they should be treated as gross ROI/QC masks, not final particle/object masks.

Interpretation: full-HDF5 sampled-frame QC did not reveal an obvious missing-frame/raw-file impossibility for event cycles 86 and 116. It provides preview artifacts for manual review and confirms that bounded particle-region-like proxy masks can be generated from the full movies. The next stronger step is to recover or recreate object-level particle crops/coordinates so the synchronized trace drops can be validated on the exact particle regions rather than downsampled full-frame proxy ROIs.

## 2026-05-21 Integrated Event Evidence Result

An integrated evidence table was added in `scripts/tier1_integrated_event_evidence.py` and run on Isambard. It merges synchrony, electrochemistry, protocol/frame-count context, recovery persistence, and full-HDF5 proxy frame QC into one auditable degradation-mode ranking.

Output directory: `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/integrated_event_evidence`

Key result:

- Cycle 116 is currently the strongest degradation-mode candidate: particles 0/1/2 drop together by mean 19.2%, all remain sustained into the next observed cycle, frame-count percentile is 0.011, mean voltage is 3.904 V, and mean current is 0.00704 mA.
- Cycle 86 is the second strongest candidate: particles 0/1/2 drop together by mean 14.2%, all remain sustained into the next observed cycle, frame-count percentile is 0.079, mean voltage is 3.822 V, and mean current is 0.00349 mA.
- Both are classified as `synchronized_persistent_drop_low_frame_count`.
- Cycles 60 and 156 are classified as `single_persistent_drop_needs_roi_qc`.
- The highest-priority next action is exact particle-region validation for cycles 116 and 86, ideally by recovering original object detector coordinates or reconstructing stable particle crops from full-frame videos.

Interpretation: the strongest NMC finding so far is not a diffusion coefficient yet; it is a ranked, evidence-backed degradation-event hypothesis. The current evidence supports coordinated persistent optical degradation at cycles 86 and 116, with a confounding association to low frame counts that must be separated from protocol/acquisition artifacts before mechanistic interpretation.

## 2026-05-21 Agentic Research Workflow Implementation

Implemented the four paper-inspired workflows as separate Isambard folders under:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/alek_jiho_nmc_deg/agentic_research`

The four workflows are:

1. `01_era_experiment_search`: ranks next computational experiments using readiness, physics yield, controls, cost, and current evidence.
2. `02_hypothesis_tournament`: scores degradation/transport hypotheses against available evidence and skeptical risks.
3. `03_closed_loop_analysis`: summarizes current outputs and writes a next-action queue.
4. `04_guarded_code_generation`: generates reviewable experiment stubs for top-ranked next analyses.

Smoke outputs are written on Isambard under:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/agentic_research_outputs`

Current ERA ranking prioritizes: frame-count/protocol matched controls, protocol-local echem window scans, ROI event visual QC, hazard calibration, and degradation-mode clustering.

## 2026-05-21 Frame-Count Matched Control Result

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier1_frame_count_matched_event_controls.py`

Output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/frame_count_matched_controls`

Key result:

- Synchronized event cycles are 86 and 116.
- Even after matched sampling against non-event cycles, their frame counts remain unusually low.
- Matched null with 20,000 draws gives:
  - observed mean frame count: 895.5 vs null mean 898.3, empirical lower-tail p = 0.00005.
  - observed mean frame-count percentile: 0.0449 vs null mean 0.0921, empirical lower-tail p = 0.00005.
- Coarse voltage/current metrics are not similarly extreme under the matched null.

Interpretation: the synchronized optical events remain tightly associated with the shortest cycle-frame regimes. This strengthens the artifact/protocol-risk concern rather than proving physical degradation. Raw ROI/event visual QC around cycles 86 and 116 is now mandatory before making a physical claim.

## 2026-05-21 Protocol-Local Echem Window Scan Result

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier1_protocol_local_window_scan.py`

Output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/protocol_local_window_scan`

Key result:

- Compared synchronized event cycles with neighboring cycles over a +/- 6 cycle window.
- Coarse per-cycle echem features do not show strong local anomalies; best local test was echem point count, p = 0.235.
- Current, voltage, duration, and simple deltas are not significant with this small event set.

Interpretation: event timing is not explained by coarse per-cycle voltage/current summaries. The next echem step should inspect within-cycle traces or protocol metadata, but the highest-priority check remains raw optical/ROI validation.

## 2026-05-21 Degradation Mode Clustering Result

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier2_degradation_mode_clustering.py`

Output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/degradation_mode_clustering`

Key result:

- K-means model selection chose k = 4 with silhouette 0.289.
- One cluster is clearly an `abrupt_drop_risk` mode: 53 particle-cycle rows, event rate 0.151, mean cycle about 89, negative delta/trailing slope, low frame-count percentile.
- The other three clusters are currently labeled stable/slow-drift variants, including later-cycle brighter/high-voltage regimes.

Interpretation: the data support an exploratory degradation-mode view, but the cluster labels are not physical mechanisms yet. They should guide QC and hypothesis generation, not serve as final claims without raw ROI/video validation and particle/region controls.

## 2026-05-21 Matched Controls And Degradation-Mode Clustering

Three additional scripts were validated and run on Isambard:

- `scripts/tier1_frame_count_matched_event_controls.py`
- `scripts/tier1_protocol_local_window_scan.py`
- `scripts/tier2_degradation_mode_clustering.py`

Output directories:

- `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/frame_count_matched_controls`
- `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/protocol_local_window_scan`
- `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/degradation_mode_clustering`

Key result:

- Frame-count/protocol matched controls reinforce that synchronized event cycles 86 and 116 are at the extreme low end of frame count, even among matched non-event cycles.
  - Observed mean frame count: 895.5; matched-null median: 897.5; empirical lower-tail p = 5.0e-5.
  - Observed mean frame-count percentile: 0.0449; matched-null median: 0.0927; empirical lower-tail p = 5.0e-5.
- Coarse local electrochemistry windows around cycles 86 and 116 still do not show strong voltage/current separation from neighboring cycles; all local-window p-values are >0.23.
- Exploratory degradation-mode clustering selected k=4 with silhouette 0.289. One cluster is labeled `abrupt_drop_risk`, containing 53 particle-cycle rows with 15.1% event rate, negative mean delta, and stronger trailing negative drops. Other clusters are stable/slow-drift modes.

Interpretation: low frame count is not merely a global loose correlate; cycles 86 and 116 are extreme even under matched controls. That makes low frame count a serious acquisition/protocol confound to resolve, not a reason to dismiss the synchronized persistent drops. The most defensible current hypothesis is a coordinated degradation-like optical transition that occurs in an unusual low-frame-count acquisition/protocol regime. Exact particle-region crop validation remains the next decisive check.

## 2026-05-21 Event Frame Proxy QC And Integrated Evidence

Pulled the Isambard-only proxy QC and integrated event evidence scripts into the repo:

- `scripts/tier1_event_frame_proxy_qc.py`
- `scripts/tier1_integrated_event_evidence.py`

Remote output directories:

- `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_frame_proxy_qc`
- `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/integrated_event_evidence`

Key proxy-QC result:

- Full-session HDF5 files are present, but chopped cycle HDF5 files referenced by `exampleParticles.csv` are not present on Isambard.
- The script samples bounded full-frame segments around event cycles and immediate neighbors, builds fixed proxy masks from temporal variability/brightness, and writes preview PNGs.
- All sampled event rows used fallback proxy masks, so these are not final particle/object masks.
- Event-cycle mean ROI CV is similar to neighbor ROI CV, and sampled stage drift is modest but nonzero.

Key integrated evidence result:

- Cycles 116 and 86 are ranked as `synchronized_persistent_drop_low_frame_count`.
- Cycle 116: three particles, mean drop fraction 0.192, sustained in 3/3 particles, frame-count percentile 0.011.
- Cycle 86: three particles, mean drop fraction 0.142, sustained in 3/3 particles, frame-count percentile 0.079.
- Cycles 60 and 156 are single-particle persistent drops needing ROI QC.

Interpretation: the strongest computational finding is now a ranked degradation-event evidence table, not a final mechanism. Cycles 86 and 116 are high-priority synchronized persistent optical-drop candidates, but the low-frame-count coupling and fallback proxy masks mean exact particle/object-detector ROI recovery is required before claiming physical degradation, phase-boundary motion, or diffusion coefficients.

## 2026-05-21 Object Detector Output Search

A direct search for original object-detection outputs was run locally and on Isambard under the Alek_Jiho tree.

Search targets:

- `particleInfo.csv`
- `particleTraces.csv`
- `segMapStack.npy`
- `maxSegMap*`
- `Output*` directories

Result:

- No original `Output - .../particleInfo.csv` or `particleTraces.csv` folders were found under `/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho`.
- The `exampleParticles.csv` address field points to Windows paths such as `D://NMC_degradation_3_160623_Halfthedata\10_c2_x10_030723chopped\10_c2_x10_030723_cycle1.hdf5`, but those chopped cycle files and their object-detection output folders are not present on Isambard.
- The repo contains legacy object detection code using SEP (`config/ObjectDetection.py`) and matching by `x`, `y`, and `npix`, so particle coordinates can likely be reconstructed from full HDF5 frames, but this is not identical to recovering the original detector outputs.

Interpretation: exact particle-region validation cannot currently use the original coordinate tables because they are missing from the accessible filesystem. The next implementable path is a reconstruction workflow: use full HDF5 segment sampling around cycles 86 and 116, run SEP-style detection on bounded frame subsets, match candidate particles across neighboring local segments, and compare reconstructed particle intensities against the provided trace-level drops.

## 2026-05-21 Candidate Front / Apparent Transport Proxy Result

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier2_event_candidate_fronts.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_candidate_fronts`

Key result:

- The script sampled 11 bounded full-HDF5 segments around event cycles and immediate neighbors, detected candidate particle-like connected components, and extracted high-intensity fraction, front-radius, and apparent radius-squared slope proxies.
- It produced 88 candidate rows, 8 per segment, plus candidate overlay previews and per-candidate traces.
- Event-cycle candidates had higher front-quality scores than neighbor candidates on average: mean 1.418 for event cycles vs 0.834 for neighbors.
- Cycle 86 has several candidate regions with moderate front-radius fit quality; best candidate score is 2.198 with front-radius R2 0.543, monotonic fraction 0.613, and a small negative apparent radius-squared slope proxy.
- Cycle 116 candidates show persistent optical drop behavior but weaker front-radius coherence; best candidate score is 1.325 with front-radius R2 0.105.

Interpretation: this is useful evidence for ranking candidate particle regions and front-like behavior, but it does not yet justify calibrated diffusion coefficients. The front proxies are in downsampled-pixel/frame units and depend on automatically detected candidate masks. The next physics step is manual validation of candidate overlays for cycles 86/116, then rerunning front tracking on validated ROIs with spatial and time calibration.

## 2026-05-21 Event Object Candidate Reconstruction

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier1_reconstruct_event_object_candidates.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_object_candidate_reconstruction`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/event_object_candidate_reconstruction`

Key result:

- The script reconstructs approximate particle-like object candidates from sampled full-session HDF5 movie segments because the original chopped HDF5 files and legacy object-detector outputs are missing.
- It sampled 13 event/neighbor segments, including event cycles 60, 86, 116, and 156.
- It generated 1,040 ranked connected-component candidates and 159 adjacent-segment nearest-candidate matches.
- Each sampled segment hit the configured cap of 80 candidates, so these tables should be treated as high-recall candidate lists rather than sparse final segmentations.
- Overlay previews were generated for all sampled segments under `overlays/`, with candidate boxes drawn on sampled mean images and background-subtracted z images.

Interpretation: this closes the immediate filesystem gap enough to support manual ROI/candidate validation without waiting for the missing Windows detector outputs. It still does not recover exact legacy particle coordinates, and the 80-candidate cap indicates a noisy/high-recall detector pass. The next useful step is to inspect the overlays for cycles 86 and 116, select validated candidate ROIs, and rerun calibrated front/intensity tracking on those selected regions.

## 2026-05-21 Event ROI Validation / Selection

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier2_select_validated_event_rois.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/event_roi_validation`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/event_roi_validation`

Key result:

- The script fused candidate-front metrics with reconstructed object candidates for synchronized event cycles 86 and 116.
- It linked 16 front/object candidates and selected the top 6 ROI candidates per event cycle.
- Cycle 86: 5/6 selected rows passed the automatic `selected_roi_candidate` label. Top selected ROI approximate full-frame coordinate is `(x=1660.7, y=191.1)` with validation score 5.378 and nearest next-sampled-segment distance 0.347 downsampled pixels.
- Cycle 116: 6/6 selected rows passed the automatic `selected_roi_candidate` label. Top selected ROI approximate full-frame coordinate is `(x=820.9, y=380.1)` with validation score 4.261 and nearest next-sampled-segment distance 0.181 downsampled pixels.
- Focused overlays were written for both cycles under `selected_overlays/`.

Interpretation: this creates a concrete, auditable ROI set for the strongest synchronized events. These are still automatically selected candidates, not manually confirmed legacy detector ROIs, but they are now specific enough to feed particle-region-only models and calibrated follow-up tracking. The next modeling step should use `selected_event_rois.csv` to crop fixed/padded particle regions from full HDF5 frames and train/evaluate event-aware next-frame or rollout models on those ROIs rather than on full frames.

## 2026-05-21 Selected ROI Sequence Export

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier2_export_selected_roi_sequences.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/selected_roi_sequences`

Local compact copy, excluding NPZ tensors:

`derived_local/selected_roi_sequences`

Key result:

- Exported particle-region-only tensors from selected synchronized-event ROIs using fixed padded crops around approximate full-frame object coordinates.
- Used 192x192 full-frame crops resized to 96x96 model inputs, with 96 sampled frames per ROI sequence.
- Exported 11 validation-label ROI sequences: 5 from cycle 86 and 6 from cycle 116.
- The remote NPZ files contain `frames`, `frames_norm`, `frame_indices`, `roi_mean`, `roi_norm_mean`, `average_intensity`, and `stage_position` arrays.
- Cycle 86 selected ROI crops have mean raw intensity delta +3.49 across sampled frames and mean normalized delta +0.000164.
- Cycle 116 selected ROI crops have mean raw intensity delta -11.31 across sampled frames and mean normalized delta -0.000690.
- Sampled XY stage drift is small but nonzero: about 0.25 for cycle 86 and 0.224 for cycle 116.

Interpretation: the project now has concrete particle-region-only model inputs for the two strongest synchronized events, satisfying the requirement that modeling should not feed full frames when selected particle regions are available. The small crop-level deltas show that the trace-level degradation signal is subtle after fixed padded cropping; next-frame/rollout models should use ROI-local contrast, temporal differencing, or event-conditioned targets rather than relying only on absolute crop mean intensity.

## 2026-05-21 Validated Front ROI Selection

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier2_select_validated_front_rois.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/validated_front_rois`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/validated_front_rois`

Key result:

- The script cross-validates candidate front regions against reconstructed object candidates and nearest neighboring-segment support for cycles 86 and 116.
- It scored 16 candidate front/object matches and selected 10 ROIs for the next front-tracking pass, 5 per event cycle.
- All 10 selected rows were labeled `candidate_roi_supported` by the automatic validation tier.
- Cycle 86 top selected front ROI: validation score 6.575, front-quality score 2.198, front-radius R2 0.543, monotonic fraction 0.613, nearest object match 2.41 downsampled pixels, nearest cycle-88 neighbor 2.21 downsampled pixels, and apparent full-pixel radius-squared proxy -0.000610 px^2/s.
- Cycle 116 top selected front ROI: validation score 5.166, front-quality score 1.255, front-radius R2 0.0067, monotonic fraction 0.742, nearest object match 1.91 downsampled pixels, nearest cycle-118 neighbor 2.28 downsampled pixels, and apparent full-pixel radius-squared proxy 0.0000413 px^2/s.
- Camera timing was read from `camera_timing` to normalize apparent transport proxies to seconds; the observed frame spacing is about 10.04 s/frame for both selected event segments.

Interpretation: this is the first front-specific, time-normalized ROI selection layer. It provides a concrete short list for high-resolution front tracking and manual QC, but the apparent transport values are still downsampled/object-candidate proxies rather than calibrated micron-scale diffusion coefficients. Cycle 86 shows the stronger front-fit evidence; cycle 116 remains a strong synchronized optical-drop event but has weaker front-radius fit quality.


## 2026-05-21 ROI-Only Rollout Baselines

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier3_roi_rollout_baselines.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/roi_rollout_baselines`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/roi_rollout_baselines`

Key result:

- Evaluated particle-region-only next-frame/rollout baselines on the 11 selected ROI sequences from cycles 86 and 116.
- Methods: persistence, velocity extrapolation, and rank-10 low-rank DMD/PCA latent dynamics.
- Persistence is the strongest short-horizon baseline, showing that selected ROI crops evolve slowly at the sampled cadence.
- Cycle 86 persistence: mean MSE 9.02e-5, SSIM 0.969.
- Cycle 116 persistence: mean MSE 1.03e-4, SSIM 0.964.
- Low-rank DMD is weaker than persistence as a pixel predictor but gives an interpretable latent state. DMD spectral radius is 1.0024, close to marginally stable dynamics.
- Cycle 86 has larger latent movement than cycle 116: mean latent path length 11.11 vs 7.59 and net displacement 1.12 vs 0.315.
- Cycle 116 has negative mean latent component-0 shift (-0.0565), while cycle 86 is positive on average (+0.0330).

Interpretation: the first ROI-only rollout experiment shows that simple persistence is a hard baseline for these slowly varying selected particle crops, so future neural next-frame models must beat a strong near-static baseline and should report residual/difference metrics. The low-rank latent dynamics provide a compact physics-facing descriptor: synchronized event cycles 86 and 116 do not behave identically, with cycle 86 showing more latent movement and cycle 116 showing a more consistent negative latent shift. This supports treating degradation mode as a latent trajectory/phase-space problem rather than only a pixel MSE problem.

## 2026-05-21 ROI Physics Descriptors And Mode Clustering

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/roi_physics_descriptors`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/roi_physics_descriptors`

Key result:

- Extracted physics-facing descriptors from the 11 selected particle-region ROI sequences: ROI mean trends, high/low optical-state fractions, radial moments, apparent front-radius trends, apparent radius-squared slope proxies, temporal residual energy, and cumulative absolute change.
- Small-sample KMeans selected k=3 with silhouette 0.311 using optical/front/dynamics descriptors.
- Most selected ROIs are `near_static_or_mixed`: 3/5 ROIs in cycle 86 and 4/6 ROIs in cycle 116.
- The remaining selected ROIs were assigned to brightening/expanding-front-like clusters: 2/5 in cycle 86 and 2/6 in cycle 116.
- Cycle 86 has higher cumulative absolute crop change than cycle 116: 0.0151 vs 0.00937.
- Cycle 86 has a more negative apparent diffusion/radius-squared proxy than cycle 116: -0.00202 vs -0.000640 normalized-image px^2/frame.
- Cycle 116 has slightly larger temporal difference energy than cycle 86: 1.05e-4 vs 8.43e-5.

Interpretation: the selected event ROIs do not show a single uniform degradation mode. The dominant behavior is slow near-static/mixed evolution, but a minority of ROIs show front-like brightening/expansion signatures. Cycle 86 appears more spatially/cumulatively active in the selected crops, while cycle 116 looks more temporally noisy but less net-displaced. These descriptors are still image-coordinate proxies; calibrated diffusion claims require spatial calibration, manual ROI validation, and time-base alignment.

## 2026-05-21 ROI Rollout Baseline Result

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier3_roi_rollout_baselines.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/roi_rollout_baselines`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/roi_rollout_baselines`

Key result:

- Evaluated 11 particle-region-only ROI sequences from selected synchronized-event crops.
- Methods were persistence, velocity extrapolation, and low-rank DMD/PCA latent rollout with rank 10 and train fraction 0.67.
- Persistence is the strongest next-frame/rollout baseline: cycle 86 mean MSE 9.02e-05 and SSIM 0.969; cycle 116 mean MSE 1.03e-04 and SSIM 0.964.
- Low-rank DMD is weaker than persistence on pixel metrics, but its latent dynamics separate the two synchronized event cycles: cycle 86 mean latent path length 11.11 and net displacement 1.12, versus cycle 116 path length 7.59 and net displacement 0.315.
- DMD spectral radius is 1.002, consistent with near-neutral latent dynamics over the evaluated crop windows.

Interpretation: for these slowly evolving ROI videos, simple persistence is a hard baseline that any neural next-frame predictor must beat. The useful physics-facing signal is not raw next-frame MSE alone; rollout residuals and latent path/displacement features are better candidates for event/degradation descriptors.

## 2026-05-21 Selected Front ROI Tracking Result

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier3_track_selected_front_rois.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/selected_front_roi_tracking`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/selected_front_roi_tracking`

Key result:

- Tracked the 10 selected validated front ROIs at full-pixel crop scale using 192x192 crops and camera-timing-normalized elapsed seconds.
- The tracker computes signed optical-change masks relative to early-frame baselines, weighted front radii, radius-squared slopes, active area fractions, and stage drift summaries.
- Cycle 86: 5 tracked ROIs, mean radius-squared slope -0.121 full px^2/s, mean radius-squared fit R2 0.184, mean apparent diffusion proxy -0.0303 full px^2/s, mean corrected ROI delta -1.89, final active fraction 0.110.
- Cycle 116: 5 tracked ROIs, mean radius-squared slope -0.201 full px^2/s, mean radius-squared fit R2 0.297, mean apparent diffusion proxy -0.0503 full px^2/s, mean corrected ROI delta -11.24, final active fraction 0.049.
- Stage drift over the sampled windows is about 0.224 in the recorded XY stage units for both cycles.

Interpretation: this gives the first high-resolution front-motion measurements on selected event ROIs. The negative radius-squared slopes suggest contracting or fading signed-change regions under the current thresholding convention, not simple outward growth. Cycle 116 has stronger mean corrected optical loss and more negative front-motion proxy, while cycle 86 has larger final active fraction. These remain apparent pixel-scale proxies; calibrated diffusion claims still require manual ROI QC, spatial calibration, and a convention-checked phase-boundary model.


## 2026-05-21 High-Resolution Selected Front ROI Tracking

Added and ran:

`scripts/tier3_track_selected_front_rois.py`

Remote output directory:

`/scratch/u6hp/nsagar.u6hp/Alek_Jiho/derived/selected_front_roi_tracking`

Local compact copy:

`derived_local/selected_front_roi_tracking`

Key result:

- Re-read full-resolution HDF5 crops around the selected cycle-86 and cycle-116 ROI candidates and tracked signed optical-change fronts over sampled event segments.
- Tracked 12 selected ROIs: 6 from cycle 86 and 6 from cycle 116.
- Fitted apparent full-pixel radius-squared slopes versus elapsed camera time. These are transport proxies, not calibrated diffusion coefficients.
- Cycle 86: mean radius^2 slope -0.127 full-px^2/s, mean apparent diffusion proxy -0.0318 full-px^2/s, mean fit R2 0.178, final active fraction 0.108, corrected ROI mean delta -1.82.
- Cycle 116: mean radius^2 slope -0.167 full-px^2/s, mean apparent diffusion proxy -0.0418 full-px^2/s, mean fit R2 0.284, final active fraction 0.0489, corrected ROI mean delta -6.63.
- Sampled XY stage drift was similar across the tracked cycle groups, about 0.224.

Interpretation: the higher-resolution crop tracking strengthens the view that the strongest synchronized events are optical-loss/contraction-like rather than simple expanding bright fronts. Cycle 116 has a stronger negative front-radius proxy and larger corrected ROI mean loss than cycle 86. Fit quality remains modest, so these values should be treated as ranked apparent transport proxies until spatial calibration, manual ROI validation, and exact time-base checks are complete.
